# Entity (object)

*Refer to model/entity.py for the current implementation*

In reality, there are no "objects" as we typically think of themâ€”just countless small elements like atoms, which behave according to the laws of physics. However, in computation-based simulations, we need to create objects, as programming languages and software do not allow us to manipulate individual atoms.

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) introduces the concept of entities, which represent these objects within the software domain. Unlike traditional objects that are often defined solely by their attributes, entities are primarily characterized by their unique identity.

## Naming

To be distinguishable, an entity must have a unique ID. To ensure this uniqueness, IDs are generated automatically. Additionally, a name property is provided to allow users to assign meaningful names to entities.

## Nature

For compatibility checks.

TODO: should the nature be mandatory?
